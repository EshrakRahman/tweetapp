## Overview
In this app, we can manage tweets and store that data on the localstorage. We can also perform delete on those tweets. Its a basic app in vanilaJs.

Users should be able to:

- Store data in localstorage
- Fetch data from localstorage
- Delete data on localstorage
- Submit and delete button for tweets

## My process
First I tried to lay out my process on paper. Then I build the UI. After building the UI I started working on
my logic. How I will implement that logic in works.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- vanillaJs
- No framework used



### What I learned

I have learned a lot of things through this project. The first thing I learned is that how to follow a process to finish a project. How to structure a project and implement those processes. As I was building the project I faced many bugs, I learned on the way to fixing those bugs.
